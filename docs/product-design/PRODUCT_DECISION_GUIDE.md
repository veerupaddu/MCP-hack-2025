# How to Decide on Product Design

Based on the TokyoDrive Insurance product design document, here's a framework for making product decisions:

## Decision Framework

### 1. Market-Driven Decisions

**Questions to Ask:**
- What does the market data tell us? (See Section 2: Market Analysis)
- What are competitors doing? (See Section 2.5: Competitive Landscape)
- What gaps exist in the market? (See Section 2.6: Market Gaps)

**Data Sources:**
- Tokyo demographics (14M+ population)
- Vehicle ownership patterns
- Traffic accident statistics
- Income levels by ward

### 2. Customer-Centric Decisions

**Questions to Ask:**
- Who is our target customer? (See Section 3: Target Customer Segmentation)
- What are their pain points? (See Section 3.5: Needs and Pain Points)
- What do they value most? (Price, Coverage, Service, Convenience)

**Decision Criteria:**
- Match product features to customer needs
- Price according to customer segments
- Design experience for target personas

### 3. Risk-Based Decisions

**Questions to Ask:**
- What are the risk factors? (See Section 5: Risk Assessment)
- How should we price for risk? (See Section 5.5: Pricing Methodology)
- What's our target loss ratio? (See Section 9.3: Loss Ratio Targets)

**Decision Criteria:**
- Geographic risk zones
- Driver age and experience
- Vehicle type and value
- Claims history

### 4. Financial Decisions

**Questions to Ask:**
- What are our financial projections? (See Section 9: Financial Projections)
- When do we break even? (See Section 9.6: Break-Even Analysis)
- What's our profitability target? (See Section 9.5: Profitability Analysis)

**Decision Criteria:**
- Premium volume targets
- Loss ratio < 70%
- Combined ratio < 100%
- Expense ratio 25-35%

### 5. Regulatory Decisions

**Questions to Ask:**
- What are the compliance requirements? (See Section 6: Regulatory Compliance)
- What's the minimum capital needed? (See Section 6.2: FSA Compliance)
- What data privacy rules apply? (See Section 6.3: Data Privacy)

**Decision Criteria:**
- FSA licensing requirements
- Minimum capital: ¥1,000M
- Data protection compliance
- Disclosure requirements

## Decision-Making Process

### Step 1: Gather Data
Query the product design document:
- "What are the financial projections for Year 1?"
- "What are the three product tiers?"
- "What is the target market size?"

### Step 2: Analyze Options
- Compare different approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs
- Consider constraints

### Step 3: Make Decision
- Use data from the document
- Consider market, customer, risk, financial, and regulatory factors
- Document rationale

### Step 4: Validate
- Check against projections
- Verify compliance
- Test assumptions

## Key Decision Points

1. **Product Tiers**: Basic, Standard, Premium (See Section 4.2)
2. **Pricing Strategy**: Competitive with value-added services (See Section 5.8)
3. **Target Market**: Tokyo residents, 25-65 years, all wards (See Section 1.3)
4. **Technology**: Digital-first platform (See Section 7: Technology)
5. **Distribution**: Online + agents (See Section 8.1: Distribution Channels)

## Using the RAG System

Ask questions like:
- "What are the premium ranges for each tier?"
- "What is the break-even point?"
- "What are the compliance requirements?"
- "What is the target loss ratio?"

The RAG system will retrieve relevant sections from the 1,600-line document to help inform your decisions.
